# business-glossary

This project aims to extract enterprise business glossaries from sanctioned documents within a company. The objective is to aggregate all glossaries across the organization into a centralized data warehouse, serving as the single source of information. This warehouse will facilitate connectivity for web applications and provide company staff with a comprehensive reference point for querying meanings of abbreviations and other terms.
Technology stacks that will be used for this project would be Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Document Intelligence, Azure AI Services (Document Intelligence) and Azure OpenAI.
