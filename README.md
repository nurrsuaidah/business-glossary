# business-glossary

This project aims to extract enterprise business glossaries from sanctioned documents within a company. The objective is to aggregate all glossaries across the organization into a centralized data warehouse, serving as the single source of information. This warehouse will facilitate connectivity for web applications and provide company staff with a comprehensive reference point for querying meanings of abbreviations and other terms.
